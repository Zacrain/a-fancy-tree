# A Fancy Tree
My personal learning project to make one fancy looking game tree.

I document my progress on blog, which I created specifically for that purpose:
https://fancytree.hashnode.dev/

This repository will contain a diorama-like short game experience made with the Godot game engine. At some point this will hopefully reach a quality level such that it can serve as a demo for others who strive to learn some aspects of creating high quality graphics in games.
